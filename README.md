# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals

Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report. Manually analyzing these applications is not efficient, error-prone, and time-consuming. This task can be automated with machine learning. In this project, weâ€™ll build an automated credit card approval using machine learning model.
